## Detailed Grammar Analysis

### Shader Languages

#### GLSL
- **Repository:** https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-glsl
- **Status:** Community-maintained under the `tree-sitter-grammars` organization; broadly adopted for GLSL parsing.
- **Maturity:** Latest tag v0.2.0 released on 2025-03-16; last commit on the same date ([GitHub](https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-glsl/releases/tag/v0.2.0)).
- **Implementation Notes:** Package `tree-sitter-glsl` (npm, crates.io, PyPI); extends `tree-sitter-c` as its foundation with no additional setup required.
- **Strategic Value:** Essential for OpenGL-based graphics applications.

#### HLSL
- **Repository:** https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-hlsl
- **Status:** Community-maintained under the `tree-sitter-grammars` organization; well-established with CI and bindings.
- **Maturity:** Latest tag v0.2.0 released on 2025-03-23; last commit on the same date ([GitHub](https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-hlsl/releases/tag/v0.2.0)).
- **Implementation Notes:** Package `tree-sitter-hlsl` (npm, crates.io, PyPI); extends `tree-sitter-cpp`, straightforward integration.
- **Strategic Value:** Targets the game development and DirectX ecosystems.

#### Metal
- **Repository:** None available.
- **Status:** No official or widely-used community Tree-sitter grammar currently exists.
- **Maturity:** N/A.
- **Implementation Notes:** A custom grammar development effort is required; would likely extend `tree-sitter-cpp` and mirror Metal’s C++-based syntax.
- **Strategic Value:** Fills a gap for Apple platform GPU programming.

### Web Frameworks
