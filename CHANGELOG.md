## [0.8.5] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- **Solidity Smart Contract Parser**: Full support for Ethereum/blockchain smart contracts
  - Comprehensive parsing of contracts, interfaces, libraries, and inheritance
  - Functions, modifiers, events, and state variable extraction
  - Struct, enum, and custom error definitions (Solidity 0.8.4+)
  - Constructor, fallback, and receive function support
  - Import statement parsing
  - **Security Pattern Detection**: Syntactic flagging for manual review
    - `selfdestruct` and deprecated `suicide` usage detection
    - `delegatecall` pattern identification
    - Assembly block detection
    - External call tracking (potential reentrancy points)
  - Full test coverage with unit and integration tests
  - Performance optimized (<70ms for 10KB files)
  - Based on JoranHonig/tree-sitter-solidity grammar

### Changed
- Updated language support count from 15+ to 20+ languages in documentation
- Added Solidity examples in Advanced Workflows section
- **AI Model Updates**: Improved default model selection for better performance
  - OpenRouter: Changed default model from `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1` to `qwen/qwen3-coder` (specialized for code)
  - OpenRouter: Updated meta-overview model from `z-ai/glm-4.5` to `z-ai/glm-4.6` (latest version)
  - Fixed incorrect model references in documentation (`gpt-5-nano` â†’ `gpt-5-mini`)

## [0.8.5] - 2025-01-30

### Fixed

- Improved code consistency and maintainability

## [0.8.4] - 2024-12-15

### Added
- **Intelligent Parser Result Merging**: Advanced approach to code parsing
  - Merges results from multiple parsers instead of picking single winner
  - 4 configurable merge strategies (confidence, union, fast_fail, best_of_breed)
  - Confidence scoring based on parser quality and completeness
  - Signature-based duplicate detection
  - Configurable via `enable_result_merging` and `merge_strategy` settings

- **Modern Syntax Support**: Built-in patterns for latest language features
  - TypeScript 5.0+ (satisfies, const assertions, type predicates)
  - Python 3.11+ (pattern matching, walrus operator, PEP 695)
  - Go 1.18+ (generics, type constraints)
  - Rust (async functions, const generics, impl Trait)
  - PHP 8.0+ (named arguments, match expressions, enums)

- **Differential Outputs**: Generate diffs between Git refs (branches, tags, commits)
  - GitPython integration for robust Git operations
  - Smart filtering shows all relevant changes
  - Rich metadata tracking (additions, deletions, renames)
  - AI-powered change summaries
  - Works with all output formats

### Changed
- **Shared Parser Infrastructure**: Eliminated 600+ lines of duplicate code
  - Unified `CommentExtractor` for all parsers
  - `ModernPatterns` registry for version-specific features
  - Utility methods consolidated in `EnhancedBaseParser`

- **Enhanced ParseResult**: New fields for intelligent merging
  - `confidence_score`: Parser confidence (0.0-1.0)
  - `parser_type`: Parser identification (tree-sitter, enhanced, standard)

## [0.8.3] - 2024-11-20

### Added
- **GitHub Direct Processing**: Process repositories without --source-url flag
  - Automatic detection of GitHub URLs and shorthand notation (owner/repo)
  - Support for SSH URLs
  - Future GitLab/Bitbucket compatibility

### Fixed
- **AI Summary Generation**: Fixed AI summary display across all formats
  - Corrected field mapping issues in Markdown writer
  - Added summary support to XML writer
  - Lowered minimum file threshold from 20 to 5 lines

### Changed
- Improved examples and corrected flag documentation

## [0.8.2] - 2024-10-15

### Added
