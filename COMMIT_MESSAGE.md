feat: Enable automatic GitHub URL detection and direct repository processing + Fix AI summary generation + Add differential outputs with GitPython

## Summary
Add smart URL detection to allow processing GitHub repositories directly without --source-url flag AND fix AI summary generation issues to ensure summaries are displayed correctly in all output formats. Additionally, implemented comprehensive differential analysis capability for CodeConcat, enabling users to generate focused outputs containing only changed files between two Git references (branches, tags, or commits) using GitPython.

## Key Changes

### Core Differential Analysis Implementation
- **New DiffCollector class** (`codeconcat/collector/diff_collector.py`):
  - Uses GitPython library for programmatic Git repository interaction
  - Validates Git references before processing
  - Collects file changes with full diff content and metadata
  - Handles binary files, renames, and all change types
  - Applies existing path filters and language rules
  - Calculates additions/deletions statistics per file

- **Extended Data Model** (`codeconcat/base_types.py`):
  - Added `DiffMetadata` dataclass to capture change information
  - Extended `AnnotatedFileData` and `ParsedFileData` with diff fields
  - Tracks additions, deletions, change types, and rename information
  - Supports binary file metadata

### CLI Integration
- Added `--diff-from` and `--diff-to` CLI options for specifying Git references
- Integrated diff mode detection in main processing pipeline
- Modified main.py to handle diff mode separately from regular collection
- Preserves diff metadata through entire processing chain

### Output Format Support

- **TextWriter** (`codeconcat/writer/text_writer.py`):
  - Terminal-optimized diff display with visual indicators
  - Shows additions with '+' and deletions with '-'
  - Compact diff statistics in summary section
  - Handles diff content separately from regular content

### AI Integration for Diffs
- **Enhanced SummarizationProcessor** (`codeconcat/processor/summarization_processor.py`):
  - Detects diff mode and creates specialized context
  - New `_create_diff_summary_prompt()` method for intelligent diff summarization
  - AI summaries focus on change impact, purpose, and risks
  - Context includes change type, line counts, and Git references

## Usage Examples

- Modified `_should_include_file()` to be more permissive in diff mode
- Verified output in all formats (Markdown, JSON, XML, Text)

### Key Fixes Applied
1. **Import Error Resolution**: Fixed import from deprecated `parser.parser` to `unified_pipeline`
2. **File Filtering**: Adjusted filters to allow config files like `.coveragerc` and `.env.example` in diff mode
3. **Diff Collection**: Confirmed GitPython integration working correctly with `from_commit.diff(to_commit)`

### Verified Functionality
- CLI integration: `codeconcat run . --diff-from main --diff-to development`
- Diff metadata properly captured (additions, deletions, change types)
- All writers correctly rendering diff content with unified diff format
- AI summarization integration working for diff content
- Security scanning still functional in diff mode

## Exception Handling Improvements (Issue #10)

### Issue Resolved
- **Issue #10**: Overly Broad Exception Handling
  - Replaced broad `except Exception as e:` clauses with specific exception types
  - Improves debugging by allowing unexpected errors to propagate
  - Makes error handling more precise and maintainable

### Changes Made

#### Enhanced Pipeline (`codeconcat/parser/enhanced_pipeline.py`)
- **Line 136**: Now catches `(ImportError, AttributeError, ValueError, TypeError)` for Tree-sitter parsing failures
- **Line 167**: Now catches `(AttributeError, ValueError, TypeError, KeyError)` for enhanced regex parsing failures
- **Line 186**: Now catches `(AttributeError, ValueError, TypeError, KeyError)` for standard regex parsing failures
- **Line 233**: Now catches `(OSError, MemoryError, SystemError)` for system-level errors only

#### GitHub Collector (`codeconcat/collector/github_collector.py`)
- **Line 63**: Now catches `(OSError, PermissionError, asyncio.TimeoutError, ValueError)` for Git operations
- **Line 98**: Now catches `(OSError, RuntimeError, asyncio.TimeoutError)` for async execution errors

#### Git Client (`codeconcat/collector/git_client.py`)
- **Line 144**: Now catches `(OSError, asyncio.TimeoutError, UnicodeDecodeError)` for async git commands
- **Line 175**: Now catches `(OSError, subprocess.SubprocessError, UnicodeDecodeError)` for sync git commands

### Benefits
1. **Better Debugging**: Unexpected exceptions now propagate, making bugs easier to identify
2. **Clear Intent**: Specific exception types indicate what errors are expected and recoverable
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand what each error handler is designed to handle
4. **Error Recovery**: Known failure modes still have appropriate recovery behavior

### Technical Analysis (via Zen Tools)
Used GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and GLM-4.5 models to analyze exception handling patterns and identify appropriate specific exception types for each operation:
- Parser operations: Focus on import, attribute, value, and type errors
- Async operations: Focus on asyncio-specific and I/O errors
- Git operations: Focus on subprocess and system-level errors
- File operations: Focus on OS and permission errors

### Testing
- All existing tests pass with new exception handling
- Parser edge cases verified to still handle errors gracefully
- Unexpected exceptions properly propagate for debugging
