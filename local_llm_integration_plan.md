# 360-Degree Review and Integration Plan for Local LLMs

This document provides a comprehensive review of the `codeconcat` AI summarization module and outlines a strategic plan for integrating local LLM providers like vLLM, LM Studio, and llama.cpp. The analysis and plan are the result of a multi-model consensus process.

## 1. Executive Summary

The proposal to unify local LLM support by consolidating around a single, flexible `LocalServerProvider` is strongly endorsed. This approach simplifies the architecture, enhances the user experience, and aligns with industry best practices. The plan involves deprecating the direct `LlamaCppProvider` in favor of a more robust server-based model, improving user configuration with a guided CLI, and creating comprehensive documentation. The existing `OpenRouterProvider` will continue to function as the primary gateway for hosted, non-OpenAI/Anthropic models.

## 2. Current Architecture

The existing AI module is well-designed with a provider-based pattern, which makes it highly extensible. The `OpenRouterProvider` serves as a versatile entry point for multiple hosted models.

                                +-------------------------+
```

## 3. Proposed Architecture & Consolidation

The core of the proposal is to deprecate the direct `LlamaCppProvider` and route all local LLM traffic through the `LocalServerProvider`. The `OpenRouterProvider` remains a distinct and important provider for accessing a variety of hosted models.

## 4. Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Refactoring and Enhancement (1-2 weeks)

1.  **Update `AIProviderType` Enum**:
    *   Add `VLLM`, `LMSTUDIO`, and `LLAMACPP_SERVER` to the `AIProviderType` enum.
    *   In `get_ai_provider` factory, map these new types to the `LocalServerProvider`, passing pre-configured default `api_base` URLs.

2.  **Enhance `LocalServerProvider`**:
    *   **Connection Validation**: Improve `validate_connection` to check common health endpoints (`/health`, `/healthz`) and provide server-specific error messages (e.g., "Connection refused at `http://localhost:1234`. Is your LM Studio server running?").
    *   **Model Auto-Discovery**: If no model is specified in the config, attempt to fetch the list of available models from the `/v1/models` endpoint and use the first one as a default.

3.  **Deprecate `LlamaCppProvider`**:
    *   Add a `DeprecationWarning` to the `LlamaCppProvider` to inform users that it will be removed in a future version and that they should switch to the server-based approach.
    *   Update documentation to reflect this change.

### Phase 2: User Experience and Tooling (1-2 weeks)

1.  **CLI Configuration Wizard**:
    *   Create a new CLI command: `codeconcat config local-llm`.
    *   This command will guide the user through an interactive setup:
        *   Ask which local server they are using (vLLM, LM Studio, etc.).
        *   Probe default ports to auto-detect the server address.
        *   Ask for the model name (or attempt to auto-discover it).
        *   Write the configuration to the user's `config.yaml`.

2.  **Comprehensive Documentation**:
    *   Create a new documentation file: `docs/LOCAL_MODELS.md`.
    *   This document will include:
        *   Step-by-step guides for setting up `codeconcat` with vLLM, LM Studio, and `llama.cpp` server.
        *   Example configurations.
        *   Troubleshooting common issues.
        *   **Performance Benchmarks**: A comparison of the different local server options to help users make informed decisions.

### Phase 3: Testing and Finalization (1 week)

1.  **Compatibility Test Suite**:
    *   Develop a test suite that runs a standard set of summarization prompts against different local server backends (vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp server).
    *   This will assert that the output format is consistent and will help catch any regressions or API inconsistencies.

2.  **Final Deprecation**:
    *   In a future major version release (as communicated in the deprecation warning), remove the `LlamaCppProvider` from the codebase.

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

*   **Risk**: Users of the direct `LlamaCppProvider` may be disrupted.
    *   **Mitigation**: A gradual deprecation process with clear warnings and a comprehensive migration guide will ensure a smooth transition.

*   **Risk**: Minor inconsistencies in the OpenAI API implementation across different local servers.
    *   **Mitigation**: A "capability detection layer" within the `LocalServerProvider` can handle these differences, and the compatibility test suite will catch them early.

*   **Risk**: Performance differences between direct and server-based integration.
    *   **Mitigation**: The inclusion of performance benchmarks in the documentation will provide transparency and help users choose the best setup for their needs.
